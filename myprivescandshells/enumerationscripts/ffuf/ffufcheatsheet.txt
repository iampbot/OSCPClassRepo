ffuf -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.102.39:3333/FUZZ -e .php,.html,.txt

-c will colorize the output
-w is the wordlist
-u is the url
FUZZ is where you want it to directory bruteforce
-e is extensions (must be seperated by commas)

without color:

ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.102.39:3333/FUZZ -e .php,.html,.txt

https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf has other options for things such as brute forcing post data pages as well as get data pages
