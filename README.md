# OSCPClassRepo

Please feel free to reach out if there is anything that you would like for me to add to this repository!!!

This repository contains notes and tools that I've gathered for the last 8 months while going through machines.

It includes tools and notes for enumeration, exploitation, buffer overflows, reverse shells, basic sql injection, tunneling, and a a little bit of common priv esc
for both linux and windows.

I'll be adding to this as I go
